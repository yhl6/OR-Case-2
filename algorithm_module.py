def heuristic_algorithm(file_path):
    
    '''
    1. Write your heuristic algorithm here.
    2. We would call this function in CS2_graded_program.py to evaluate your algorithm.
    3. Please do not change the function name and the file name.
    4. The parameter is file path of data file.
    5. You need to return the order plan in list in order.
            order[i][j][t] is amount of product i ordered in the beginning of month t with shipping method j.
            i = 1, ..., |number of product|, j = 1, 2, 3, and t = 1, ..., 26.
       Note that the indice of list need to be in order, that is , return order[i][j][t] rather than order[t][j][i]
    6. You only need to submit this algorithm_module.py.
